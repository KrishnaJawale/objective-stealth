You must start at the roofand have to stealthily make your way through enemies to the first floor where the\nobjective is. However, there is only a SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY from one floor to the next: an elevator, one on each \nfloor.

This task is made no easier by that fact that you may NOT kill any enemies, and when you collect\nyour objective, you will have to sneak your way back to the roof again where a helicopter will await you.");
